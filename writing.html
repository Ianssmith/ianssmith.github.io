<h2>Words</h2>
<h5>It is strange, and sad, to me how often these days </h5>
<h5>people interrupt each other and talk over one another. </h5>
<h5>I would agree that a picture is worth a thousand words, </h5>
<h5>but a word can also have a thousand meanings itself, </h5>
<h5>and if you value the words you speak as having meaning </h5>
<h5>you would listen to the words of others with equal intent to the ones you speak.</h5>

<h2>Right on Target</h2>
<h5>I was there the day your waited for me</h5>
<h5>I went early and bought vibrant colored chalk to leave you a message on the pavement.</h5>
<h5>But the people there would not permit me</h5>
<h5>Land of the free</h5>
<h5>Maybe if I were braver I would have asked for forgiveness instead of permission</h5>
<h5>I would have once</h5>
<h5>But I've learned the hard way there is no forgiveness here</h5>
<h5>I am sorry</h5>

<h2>помнить</h2>
<h5>My love I speak in quiet words every day to you</h5>
<h5>whispered as I carry my loads from here to there</h5>
<h5>My shoulders ache and my thighs they tremble</h5>
<h5>But it is only a balm to my heart</h5>
<h5>for my members to share in the knowledge of it's pain</h5>
<h5>And yet my eyes they shine and my smile is unyeilding</h5>
<h5>In what we shared and will share</h5>
<h5>I remember your hands I massaged in the cold</h5>
<h5>And the tears I wiped from your eyes</h5>
<h5>How I longed for the moment I would hear your voice</h5>
<h5>Each time like coming home after a long journey</h5>
<h5>The stories you gently spoke to me late in the night</h5>
<h5>You are like tempered steel in a blazing sun</h5>
<h5>When my mind first emerges from sleep your name solitary and crisp accompanies it</h5>
<h5>When I eat my meals it is your sustenance and enjoyment I taste</h5>
<h5>In idle moments you are the tears in my eyes</h5>
<h5>When I feel the breeze on my skin in a dark calm night</h5>
<h5>When I hear the notes of our music</h5>
<h5>I'm dancing with you once again like a fool in the king's court</h5>
<h5>You will do what you must, but I will keep my promises to you</h5>
<h5>My soul, your eyes pierce me deeper than any blade</h5>
<h5>Your smile is my smile and somehow I've always known you</h5>
<h5>and time has no meaning at all</h5>
