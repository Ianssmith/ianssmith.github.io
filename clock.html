    <h4 style="color:black;"><\t>Based on a hexagonal origami tesselation, this clock has 3 layers indicating seconds, minutes, hours, and a middle cell indicating the time of day. The second and minute layers each have 30 cells changing from white to grey for the first 30 seconds or minutes, and then from grey to black for the second 30. The inner 6 cells similarly represent dialy hours from 12am-6am changing from black to grey; From 6am-12pm from grey to white; From white back to grey from 12pm-6pm, and finally from grey to black moving toward midnight. The center cell indicates which quarter of the 24-hour period you are in from grey, to white, to grey, to black respectively. </h4>
